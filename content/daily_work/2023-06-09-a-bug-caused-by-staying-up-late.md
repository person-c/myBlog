I accidentally confronted a bug in committing my modifications on my website —— my new blog on June 1 can't be presented on my website; The blog was written at 2. am in China; After many possible fixes, I finally found that it was triggered by jet lag: China is 12 hours ahead of the United States, so when I committed a blog with June 1 announcement at 2. am in China, the hours in the United States was May 31st. No blog was written on June 1 when hours were May 31st. This reminds me of not burning the midnight oil...
