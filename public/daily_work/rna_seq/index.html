            <div><p>Recently, ChatGPT is overwhelming the Chinees internet with many applications deployed. It not only supplies powerful abilities to process many boring and repetitive work many white collars do but also brings unemployment concerns for many people engaged in the internet field. What&rsquo;s the future of the internet like? I don&rsquo;t know, but I think it&rsquo;s indeed a powerful tool to help us learn, especially in cases when what we want to know is something common but scattered across the internet which cost us much time to filter from many pages. AI&rsquo;s performance in summarizing information from the internet is impressive, so it&rsquo;s a useful tool for learning knowledge widespread existed on the internet, such as programming. I have tried to learn javascript for a few days, and the most annoying thing I encountered was many methods&rsquo; arguments and usage, but I accidentally found Al can solve this problem perfectly —— just ask AI to give a concrete example of the method you want to learn, it can respond with a detailed description. Nice! AI can handle such specific questions perfectly, what we need to do is to design the whole theory structure we want to learn;</p>
<p>Try to learn to be a good questioner to better use the powerful AI tools!</p>
